# reactive-sample
Vertx and spring5 webflux (annotations and functional based approaches).
+ Gatling load tests.

## Applications are pretty simple: 
1. get json input
2. convert to model
3. convert back to json
4. return

## Notes
 - mvn clean package - to create fat jars
 - all applications are run on 8080 port
 - Gatling test can be run from IDE(mvn package first) or via gatling.sh
